# oasis-generator
Experimental generator producing single- and multi-ASI foresight scenarios using open hermeneutic models.

The **OASIS Generator Alpha** is an experimental tool for producing foresight-style reports on potential futures of Artificial Superintelligence.
It can generate both **single-agent (ASI)** and **multi-agent (poly-ASI)** scenarios, each accompanied by interpretive narratives and thematic indicators.

This module represents the first step toward the larger OASIS Observatory ecosystem.

**Status:** Alpha — open for testing and conceptual feedback.

✳️ Focus: narrative coherence, scenario diversity, and epistemic transparency.
